# Puzzle Plane

A small beginner web project (HTML/CSS/JS) by Katerina Mäenpää — my second ever coding project.

What this is
- A multi-page, kid-friendly puzzle game. The main entry is `index.html`; from there you can open the games.
- Images are hosted online (Imgur and other CDNs) so they are not stored locally.

How to view locally
- Quick: open `index.html` in your browser.
- Recommended: run a simple local server so navigation works reliably:
  - Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

    python3 -m http.server 8000

  - Open http://localhost:8000/index.html in your browser.

Notes
- Pages currently contain inline CSS and JS for simplicity. 
- This is an early learning project.
